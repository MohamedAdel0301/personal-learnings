in this section, various problem solving patterns were introduced, along with the brute-force way to solve such problems

## two pointers pattern

This pattern was used to solve counting unique values and finding the first sum that equals zero
**best used when the given iterable is sorted**
If requirements are met, it can solve problems in linear time.

## frequency counter pattern

This pattern was used to solve two problems, valid anagram and the quadratic freq counter
**best used with objects or sets to avoid quadratic time**

## sliding window pattern

This approach is great for dealing with subsets of data inside a one-dimensional iterable
**solves problems in linear time**
